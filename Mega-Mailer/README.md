This `Mega Mailer` challenge is one of the hardest web challenges in this CTF. Me and my teammates need to spend a lot of times on this challenges. However This was a nice challenges.

When We go to website, we can see that we can put `SMTP Ip and Port` and We can see `Example CSV file` named `recipitents(1).csv`.

# Thinking The Vulnerability

First i am spending time with injecting `SQL injection` and `XSS`. We got `500` error everytime. And After a while one of my teammates found that we need to put real `SMTP server and port.` So i tested `smtp.google.com` in `Host` field  and put `25 in Port` field. and we submit it but get `500` error. What?ðŸ¤”.

After a while, i understand that we need to put `recipitents(1).csv` to submit our input to ping to `smtp.google.com`. So tried to ping with the file and got success. we can ping but not get anything. But THis is our first success.

After while, i got a idea to run our `smtp` server locally and do `port forward` to make our local `smtp server` to be global. So we can get response from server in our machine.

For that i used free `vps container` service called [goorm](https://ide.goorm.io/) that can do port forward.

And i host my `smtp` server in vps locally by python3 `python3 -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n 0.0.0.0:45` and do port forward.

And i put the `vps machine port forwarded ip and port` in Host and port field and Test the `SSTI` in `Main Body` field.

And got response back with `4`. So that mean our `SSTI` injection is success. Bingo! ðŸ˜‹

After tesing many `SSTI` payloads. One payload from [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection) worked.

The Payload is `{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}` and it worked and return with flag. Bingo! again ðŸ˜‹.
